		<p>For my game, I decided to go with the theme of watering a flower and avoiding bugs.</p>
		<p> I really love to make graphics of plants and food smiling, so this was a fun little project for me.
			The graphics are little sketches of what would probably normally be pixel art, but even still,
		I liked the way that the game came out looking in the end.</p>
		<p>At first, I really wanted to write a game where the flower would be walking around with an animated walk cycle,
			and would use its leaves as swords to fend off bugs.  It was a bit too ambitious for me given my time restraints,
		and I instead decided to go with the simple "things fall but you gotta catch the right thing" type of game.</p>
		<p>I'm not incredibly pleased with the end product, since it's fairly simple, but I feel that it came together nicely
			given the amount of time and complexity of the project.  I especially like that I had the bugs move in little paths of their own depending
			on some random variables.</p>
			<p>Lastly, here is an image of the controller that my group made in class with our makey-makey!  We used my breakout game with this controller, mapping one side of foil to A,
				and the other side of the foil to D.  I also later on created a "potato controller" literally with 8 potatoes as different mouse keys.</p>
